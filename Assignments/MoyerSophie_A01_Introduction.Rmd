## 1) Finish setting up R Studio

### Install TinyTex
Now, run this code cell the same way. This will install "tinytex" -- a helper app that allows you to knit your markdown documents into professional quality PDFs.
```{r install tiny tex, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#install tinytext
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

### Set your default knit directory
This setting will help deal with relative paths later on...
 - From the Tool menu, select `Global Options`
 - Select the RMarkdown section
 - In the "Evaluate chunks in directory", set the option to "Project"


## 2) Discussion Questions
Enter answers to the questions just below the >Answer: prompt.

1. What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

> Answer: In undergrad, I took an introductory class on R, so I have some experience with using it for simple projects. We created lots of graphics/visuals from R, as well as completed a final project in which we were given a large data set and had to come up with research questions and then analysize the data through various methods. 

2. Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: I am fairly confident with the basics of working in R, different R packages, and machine learning. 

3. Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?

> Answer: I have never used GitHub in this way before, so I am a bit apprehensive of how it all works. 


## 3) GitHub

Provide a link below to your forked course repository in GitHub. Make sure you have pulled all recent changes from the course repository and that you have updated your course README file, committed those changes, and pushed them to your GitHub account.
